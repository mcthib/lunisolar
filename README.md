#lunisolar

## A Chinese lunisolar utility package, including conversion to/from the Gregorian calendar.

The Chinese lunisolar calendar is a lunar calendar that was in use before widespread adoption of the Gregorian (western) calendar. It is still used for certain traditional applications such as birthdays, holidays and horoscopes.

A good description of this calendar can be found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar).
